# Project Plan Document

## Project Overview
This document outlines the project plan for the development of our programming language parser and interpreter, detailing both the estimated and actual time taken for each phase of the project. The development was conducted entirely through pair programming, ensuring an equal contribution from both group members.

## Team Members
- Member 1: Cameron Bussom
- Member 2: Dharmik Patel

## Development Methodology
- **Approach:** Pair Programming
- **Description:** Both team members participated equally in each stage of the project, collaborating on the design, implementation, and testing of the software.

## Task Breakdown, Estimated and Actual Time

### 1. Requirements Gathering
- **Objective:** Define the requirements and specifications of the language and its features.
- **Estimated Time:** 5 hours
- **Actual Time:** 6 hours
- **Details:** Additional time was spent refining the language specifications after initial feedback.

### 2. Language Design
- **Objective:** Design the syntax and core features of the language.
- **Estimated Time:** 10 hours
- **Actual Time:** 11 hours
- **Details:** Some complexities in the syntax required extra time to finalize.

### 3. Lexer Implementation
- **Objective:** Develop the lexer to tokenize the input code.
- **Estimated Time:** 7.5 hours
- **Actual Time:** 7 hours
- **Details:** The task was completed slightly faster than expected due to effective pre-planning.

### 4. Parser Implementation
- **Objective:** Develop the parser to create an abstract syntax tree from tokens.
- **Estimated Time:** 12.5 hours
- **Actual Time:** 15 hours
- **Details:** Faced challenges with implementing some complex parsing rules, leading to extra hours.

### 5. AST and Interpreter Implementation
- **Objective:** Implement the abstract syntax tree (AST) and the interpreter to execute the code.
- **Estimated Time:** 15 hours
- **Actual Time:** 17.5 hours
- **Details:** Integrating some features into the interpreter took longer than anticipated.

### 6. Testing and Debugging
- **Objective:** Test the software to ensure it works as expected and debug any issues.
- **Estimated Time:** 10 hours
- **Actual Time:** 12.5 hours
- **Details:** More edge cases were found than initially expected, requiring additional testing and debugging time.

### 7. Documentation
- **Objective:** Document the software and its usage.
- **Estimated Time:** 7.5 hours
- **Actual Time:** 7.5 hours
- **Details:** The task met the estimated time as the documentation was straightforward.

### 8. Final Review and Adjustments
- **Objective:** Conduct a final review of the project and make necessary adjustments.
- **Estimated Time:** 2.5 hours
- **Actual Time:** 3 hours
- **Details:** Some last-minute refinements were needed to enhance functionality and user experience.

## Conclusion
- **Total Estimated Time:** 70 hours
- **Total Actual Time:** 80.5 hours
- **Overall Analysis:** The project took more time than estimated primarily due to complexities encountered during the parser and interpreter implementation stages. Both team members contributed equally to every phase, reflecting a well-coordinated effort in all aspects of the project.

## Percentage of Work Contributed
- **Cameron:** 50%
- **Dharmik:** 50%
- **Justification:** All tasks were completed through pair programming, ensuring an equal division of labor and collaborative problem-solving throughout the project.
