# Symplnym Maintainability Document

## Introduction

The Symplnym programming language is designed with maintainability as a core principle. This document outlines the practices and design decisions that contribute to the ease of understanding, correcting, adapting, and enhancing the software.

## Documentation Practices

- **Inline Code Comments:** Each function and major block of code includes descriptive comments that explain the purpose and logic of the code, making it easier for new developers to understand the existing codebase.
  
- **API Documentation:** Public interfaces are documented with explanations of their parameters, return values, and usage examples. This documentation is kept up to date with the codebase to ensure consistent understanding.
  
- **Change Log:** A running change log is maintained, documenting all changes made to the software, including bug fixes, feature additions, and modifications for future reference.

## Code Organization

- **Modular Design:** The code is structured in a modular fashion, with distinct separation between the lexer, parser, and interpreter components. This separation makes it easier to update individual parts without affecting others.
  
- **Consistent Naming Conventions:** We use clear and descriptive naming for variables, functions, and modules, which aids in readability and understanding of the code's purpose.

- **Refactoring:** Regular refactoring is performed to simplify complex code, reduce duplication, and improve performance, ensuring the code remains clean and efficient.

## Design Decisions

- **Language Simplicity:** Symplnym’s syntax and language features were designed to be intuitive. This choice was made to simplify the learning curve for new users and to facilitate readability and maintainability.

- **Extensibility:** The language was designed to be easily extendable. New features can be added with minimal impact on the existing system by following the established modular patterns.

- **Error Handling:** The interpreter is designed to provide clear, understandable error messages. This helps maintainers quickly pinpoint issues in the code.

## Product Design Justifications

- **Data Type Representations:** Symplnym uses distinct types for different data representations (numbers, decimals, words, lists), which simplifies type checking and reduces runtime errors.

- **Control Flow Constructs:** The inclusion of `if` and `otherwise` statements mirrors traditional programming paradigms, making the control flow within the language familiar to seasoned developers.

- **Memory Management:** The language leverages Rust’s ownership and borrowing mechanisms, ensuring memory safety without the need for a garbage collector, which can be a source of complexity and performance issues.

## Conclusion

Symplnym is built with a focus on maintainability, ensuring that the software is robust and adaptable for future growth. Through comprehensive documentation, a modular codebase, and thoughtful design decisions, Symplnym stands as a maintainable and user-friendly programming language.
