## 2. Final Version of Language Whitepaper and Language Specification Documentation

### Language Whitepaper
Symplnym is a programming language designed to be powerful and flexible, enabling programmers to write clear and efficient code for solving a variety of problems. The language promotes clarity, flexibility, and efficiency through its straightforward syntax and comprehensive feature set.

### Language Specification
- Symplnym employs a clear and concise syntax similar to writing in English for better readability and understanding.
- The language supports various data types, including numbers, decimals, lists, words, letters, and flags.
- Symplnym provides a set of reserved words that form the core vocabulary of the language.
- Operators are available for performing mathematical calculations, comparisons, and logical operations.
- Control structures, such as if, otherwise, and choose, are used to manage the flow of program execution.
- Loops and functions are supported for code reuse and organization.

## 3. Language Tutorial with at Least One Example Exercise

### Tutorial
Symplnym is designed to be intuitive and easy to learn. Here's a simple tutorial to get started:

1. Variable Declaration:
   - Use the keywords `number`, `decimal`, `words`, `list`, or `letter` to declare variables of different types.
   - Example: `number myNum = 42`

2. Arithmetic Operations:
   - Symplnym supports basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo, and exponentiation.
   - Example: `number result = 10 + 5`

3. Control Flow:
   - Symplnym provides `if`, `otherwise`, and `choose` statements for conditional execution and multi-way selection.
   - Example: `if (myNum > 0) { print 'Positive' }`

### Example Exercise
Write a Symplnym program that calculates the sum of two numbers and prints the result.
```
number num1 = 10
number num2 = 20
number sum = num1 + num2
print 'The sum of '
print num1
print ' and '
print num2
print ' is: '
print sum
```


## 4. Language Reference Manual - Language Key Words and How to Use Them Syntactically

### Keywords
- `number`: Declares a whole number variable.
- `decimal`: Declares a number with a fractional part.
- `words`: Declares a string variable.
- `list`: Declares an ordered collection.
- `letter`: Declares a single character variable.
- `flag`: Declares a boolean variable.
- `loop`: Defines a loop construct.
- `func`: Defines a function.
- `if`: Defines a conditional statement.
- `otherwise`: Defines an alternative branch of a conditional statement.
- `choose`: Defines a multi-way selection statement.
- `start`: Marks the beginning of a block.
- `end`: Marks the end of a block.
- `complete`: Indicates the completion of a statement or block.'
- `loop`: makes a loop to do tasks multiple times.'
- `give-back`: Returns a value from a function.

### Syntax
- Variable Declaration: `<type> <variable_name> = <value>`
- Arithmetic Operations: `<variable> = <expression>`
- Function Declaration: `func <function_name>(<parameters>) { <statements> }`
- Conditional Statement: `if (<condition>) { <statements> }`
- Multi-way Selection: `choose (<expression>) { <case1>: <statements1> <case2>: <statements2> ... }`
- Loop: `loop (<condition>) { <statements> }`
- Print Statement: `print <value>`

## 9. Conclusions - Post Mortem Documentation

### Team Conclusions
- The project was successfully completed within the estimated timeline.
- The language design phase took longer than expected due to discussions and iterations.
- The implementation phase went smoothly thanks to the well-defined language specifications.
- Testing and documentation required more effort than initially anticipated.

### Individual Conclusions
- Dharmik Patel: I learned a lot about language design and parsing techniques during this project.
- Cameron Busson: Implementing the interpreter was a challenging but rewarding experience.
